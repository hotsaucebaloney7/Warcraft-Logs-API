# Assignment 6 - Internet Data

Advanced Python for Data Science, CIS 454; University of Maine at Augusta, Fall 2021

## Overview 

This repository contains the files necessary to complete Assignment 6, Internet Data.

In this assignment you will work with  JSON and REST to download datasets form the internet into your python program. The entire assignment is contained in one Jupyter Notebook. 

## Clone Repository

To work on the assignment you will want to clone this repository to your local computer.   Refer to the instructions from Assignment 1 to review the process.

## Complete the Notebook

Within the notebook complete the following tasks:    

1. Run the cells to explore the hands-on introduction of creating REST requests and processing the data returned via the RESTfull server
2. Find a RESTfull service you find interesting; create a request to obtain a resource from that service and do something usefull with it

As you build out this notebook create lots of cells -- small snippets of code followed or prefaced by comments in "markdown" cells.   A complete solution will be well structured and well documented.

## Rubric

The rubric for this assignment:

- 50 poits: evidence that you completed the hands-on introduction
- 30 points: an interesting RESTfull service is identified and explored
- 20 points something usefull is done with the returned resource

## Commit & Push Your work
